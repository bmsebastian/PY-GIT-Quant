QTrade v14A - Complete Session Summary & Continuation Guide
Date: 2025-01-12
Session Goal: Fix critical bugs in QTrade v14A trading system
Status: ‚úÖ 95% Complete - One file replacement needed

üìã EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Successfully diagnosed and fixed 6 critical bugs in QTrade v14A:

‚úÖ Wrong breakout scanner (no capacity management)
‚úÖ Market scanner exceeding subscription limits
‚úÖ Missing position priority in subscriptions
‚úÖ Unsafe tick handling (NaN crashes)
‚úÖ Dashboard API errors (dataclass access)
‚úÖ Dark theme ‚Üí White theme conversion

Current Issue: User needs to replace dashboard_server.py with fixed version (hasn't replaced yet).

üèóÔ∏è SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
QTrade v14A Overview:

Type: Quantitative trading platform for Interactive Brokers
Language: Python 3.8+
Framework: ib_insync, Flask dashboard
Mode: Paper trading (DRY_RUN=0, ENV=paper)
IB Connection: 127.0.0.1:7497 (TWS Paper)

Key Components:

TradeManager - Position tracking & orchestration
MarketDataBus - Subscription management (50-limit IB)
ScannerCoordinator - Dual scanner system:

BreakoutScanner (positions, 10s intervals)
MarketScanner (IB scanner API, 60s intervals)


Dashboard - Flask web UI at http://localhost:8052
StateBus - Thread-safe global state

Subscription Priority System:

100 (PRIORITY_POSITION): Open positions - NEVER removed
50 (PRIORITY_SCANNER_TOP): High-scoring breakout signals
25 (PRIORITY_SCANNER_NORMAL): Regular scanner results


üêõ BUGS IDENTIFIED & FIXED
Bug #1: Wrong Breakout Scanner (CRITICAL)
Problem:

scanner_coordinator.py imported basic scanner without capacity management
Could exceed 50-subscription IB limit
from strategies.breakout_scanner import BreakoutScanner (wrong version)

Fix:

Created capacity-aware breakout_scanner.py
Auto-limits scanner to available slots
Respects position buffer (5 slots)

Status: ‚úÖ Fixed in artifact

Bug #2: Market Scanner Subscription Overflow
Problem:

scanner.py subscribed without checking 50-limit
No capacity checks before self.md.subscribe()

Fix:

Added get_scanner_capacity() check
Pre-flight capacity calculation
Graceful "at limit" warnings

Status: ‚úÖ Fixed in artifact

Bug #3: Missing Position Priority
Problem:

trade_manager.py line ~89: self.mdb.subscribe(sym, r["contract"])
No priority parameter = positions treated like scanner symbols
Could be removed during cleanup!

Fix:
pythonfrom config import PRIORITY_POSITION
self.mdb.subscribe(sym, r["contract"], priority=PRIORITY_POSITION)
Status: ‚úÖ Fixed in artifact

Bug #4: Unsafe Tick Handling
Problem:

market_data.py called ticker.marketPrice() / ticker.midpoint() without error handling
NaN values caused crashes
Method calls could raise exceptions

Fix:
python# Protected method calls
try:
    mp = ticker.marketPrice()
    if mp is not None and not math.isnan(mp):
        px = mp
except Exception as e:
    logger.debug(f"marketPrice() failed: {e}")
Status: ‚úÖ Fixed in artifact

Bug #5: Dashboard API Errors (NOT REPLACED YET)
Problem:
python# Line 514 - WRONG:
"ts": STATE.heartbeat.get("ts", "")  # ‚ùå Heartbeat is dataclass, not dict

# Snapshot error:
price_data = STATE.prices.get(symbol).get('last')  # ‚ùå Assumes dict
Fix:
python# Correct dataclass access:
hb = STATE.heartbeat
"ts": hb.ts if hasattr(hb, 'ts') else ""

# Safe price access:
price_data = STATE.prices.get(symbol_upper)
if isinstance(price_data, dict):
    last_price = price_data.get('last')
elif isinstance(price_data, (int, float)):
    last_price = price_data
Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è FIXED in artifact BUT USER HASN'T REPLACED FILE YET

Bug #6: Dark Theme Dashboard
Problem: Dark background hard to read
Fix: Complete white theme redesign with:

Clean white background (#f8fafc)
Professional gradients
Better contrast
Modern card design

Status: ‚úÖ Included in dashboard fix

‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING (Verified from Logs)
From user's latest run (15:56:54):

‚úÖ IB Connection: Connected to 127.0.0.1:7497 successfully
‚úÖ Position Filtering: 9 non-tradable symbols filtered correctly

TOGI, MRAI, KALRQ, AZREF (OTC)
CNCE.CVR, RFP.CVR, FUSN.CVR (CVR rights)

‚úÖ Priority Subscriptions: All positions at priority=100
‚úÖ Subscription Limit: Hit exactly 50/50 (working perfectly!)
‚úÖ Capacity Warnings: "NEAR LIMIT" warnings active
‚úÖ Historical Fallback: Weekend mode working (fetching historical data)
‚úÖ Scanner System: Both scanners initialized and running
‚úÖ Capacity Management: "Cannot subscribe: at limit (50/50)" working

Positions: 3 (NQZ5, TSLA, CLZ5)
Scanner capacity: 45 slots available

‚ùå WHAT'S STILL BROKEN
1. Dashboard API Errors (Only Remaining Issue)
Error:
AttributeError: 'Heartbeat' object has no attribute 'get'
Snapshot error: 'float' object has no attribute 'get'
Location: dashboard_server.py line 514
Cause: User hasn't replaced dashboard_server.py with fixed version
Evidence:

Error shows line 514 with old code: STATE.heartbeat.get("ts", "")
Fixed version has different code at different line number
File timestamp likely unchanged


üîß IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED
Step 1: Stop QTrade
powershell# Press Ctrl+C in terminal
Step 2: Backup Old File (Safety)
powershellCopy-Item .\dashboard_server.py .\dashboard_server.py.BACKUP
Step 3: Download Fixed Version

Look at LEFT SIDEBAR in Claude
Find: "dashboard_server.py (FINAL FIX)"
Click download button (‚¨áÔ∏è)
Save to: C:\Users\bmseb\qtrade\
Confirm overwrite when prompted

Step 4: Verify Replacement
powershell# Check file modification time
Get-Item .\dashboard_server.py | Select-Object LastWriteTime

# Search for the fix
Select-String -Path .\dashboard_server.py -Pattern "FIX: Access dataclass"
If you see "FIX: Access dataclass" in output = FILE REPLACED ‚úÖ
Step 5: Restart
powershellpython .\main.py
Step 6: Verify Dashboard Works

Open: http://localhost:8052
Check for errors in terminal
Should see:

‚úÖ No "AttributeError" messages
‚úÖ White background dashboard
‚úÖ Live position data
‚úÖ Subscription gauge working

üìö IMPORTANT CONTEXT FOR NEXT CHAT
User's Environment:

OS: Windows (PowerShell)
Python: 3.8+ with venv (.venv)
Location: C:\Users\bmseb\qtrade\
IB: TWS Paper Trading on port 7497
Dashboard: http://127.0.0.1:8052

User's Skill Level:

Git: Has git but not confident
Python: Can run scripts, not confident editing
Trading: Experienced trader
Debugging: Needs guidance

Files Successfully Replaced:

‚úÖ strategies/breakout_scanner.py
‚úÖ scanner.py
‚úÖ trade_manager.py
‚úÖ market_data.py
‚ö†Ô∏è dashboard_server.py - NOT REPLACED YET

System Behavior:

Weekend mode: Historical data fallback working
Subscription system: Hitting 50/50 perfectly
Position filtering: Working flawlessly
Scanner coordination: Both scanners operational

Known Issues:

Dashboard API crashes due to dataclass access bug
User sees errors every 2 seconds in terminal
Dashboard probably showing loading errors
But core trading system is working fine!


üîÑ CONTINUING IN NEXT CHAT
If Dashboard Still Broken:

Ask user to verify file replacement:

powershell   Select-String -Path .\dashboard_server.py -Pattern "FIX: Access dataclass"

If not found = user didn't replace file
Guide through file replacement again
Consider using Remove-Item first to avoid confusion

If Dashboard Working:

‚úÖ Celebrate success!
Monitor logs for any other issues
Consider next enhancements:

Add unit tests
Implement subscription TTL
Centralize bar data tracking
Add email/Slack alerts



Common User Confusion:

May think they replaced file but didn't
Check file timestamps and search for fix markers
Windows file system can be tricky (file locks, etc.)
May need to close IDE/editor before replacing

Key Log Messages (Good):
‚úÖ Subscribed LIVE XXX (priority=100)
‚úÖ Tracking 3 tradable positions
‚úÖ Filtered 9 non-tradable symbols
‚úÖ Position scanner tracking 3 holdings

üéâ BOTTOM LINE
System is 95% working perfectly!
The subscription management, position filtering, priority system, and core trading logic are all functioning flawlessly. The ONLY remaining issue is the dashboard API crashes because the user hasn't replaced dashboard_server.py yet.
Next step: Help user successfully replace that ONE file, then everything will work! üöÄ
