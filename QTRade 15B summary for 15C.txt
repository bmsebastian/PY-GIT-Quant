## 🐛 BUGS FIXED IN THIS SESSION

### **Bug #1: Missing `build_and_qualify()` Function** ❌→✅
**File:** `contracts.py`  
**Problem:** Scanner called non-existent function  
**Fix:** Added complete function to build and qualify IB contracts

### **Bug #2: IB Connection Timeout** ❌→✅
**File:** `ib_client.py`  
**Problem:** Connection timed out fetching execution history for 12 positions  
**Fix:** Added `readonly=True` to skip slow execution requests

### **Bug #3: Position Data Missing v15 Fields** ❌→✅
**File:** `trade_manager.py`  
**Problem:** Missing `sec_type`, `local_symbol`, `multiplier` for v15 compatibility  
**Fix:** Enhanced position data structure with all v15 fields

### **Bug #4: MACD Unpacking Error** ❌→✅
**File:** `professional_scanner.py` line 343  
**Problem:** `macd()` returns 3 values but code unpacked only 2  
**Fix:** Updated to `macd_line, signal_line, histogram = macd(...)`

### **Bug #5: Indentation Error** ❌→✅
**File:** `professional_scanner.py`  
**Problem:** Artifact was incomplete snippet, not full file  
**Fix:** Provided complete 450+ line working file

### **Bug #6: Async Event Loop in Thread** ❌→✅
**Files:** `scanner_coordinator.py`, `main.py`  
**Problem:** Background thread had no event loop for `ib_insync`  
**Fix:** Moved scanner to main thread, call via `tick()` every 10s

⚠️ MINOR ISSUES (Non-Critical)
Issue #1: Unicode Logging Errors
Symptom: UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u2713'
Impact: Cosmetic only - checkmarks (✓) don't display in Windows console
Workaround:
powershellchcp 65001  # Change console to UTF-8
# OR
$env:PYTHONIOENCODING='utf-8'
python .\main.py
```
**Priority:** Low - System works fine

### **Issue #2: Futures Contract Warnings**
**Symptom:** `Error 200: The destination or exchange selected is Invalid`  
**Impact:** Futures subscribe but with warnings  
**Fix:** Update `scanner_coordinator.py` line ~230 (artifact provided)  
**Priority:** Medium - Futures work but logs are noisy

### **Issue #3: No Scanner Results Yet**
**Symptom:** `Market scanner found 0 candidates`  
**Cause:** Pre-market has low volume, scanner needs 60+ scores  
**Expected:** Results will appear after 9:30 AM ET market open  
**Priority:** None - This is normal behavior

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

### **Immediate (Optional)**

1. **Fix Futures Contract Creation**
   - Download updated artifact "scanner_coordinator.py (MAIN THREAD v15B)"
   - Replace existing file
   - Fixes noisy error logs

2. **Fix Unicode Logging**
   - Run: `chcp 65001` before starting QTrade
   - OR add to startup script

### **Wait for Market Open (9:30 AM ET)**

Scanner will activate when:
- Market opens and volume increases
- Stocks meet 60+ point threshold
- IB scanner returns qualified candidates

**Expected behavior:**
```
--- Running Stock Scanner ---
Market scanner found 50 candidates
  AAPL: 72.4 (B)
  NVDA: 68.1 (B)
  TSLA: 63.7 (C)
Top 10 stocks to monitor
Subscribed AAPL (pri 25) - 13/50
...
```

### **Monitor First Hour**

Watch for:
- Scanner finding qualified stocks (60+ scores)
- Subscriptions auto-rotating (stale cleanup every 10 min)
- Dashboard showing breakout signals
- No crashes or connection drops

🎓 KEY LESSONS LEARNED
1. ib_insync Requires Event Loops

Background threads need event loops
Solution: Run scanner in main thread via tick()
Main thread already has IB event loop

2. Readonly Mode Prevents Timeouts

Execution history requests are slow (12 positions = 8+ seconds)
readonly=True skips these requests
QTrade doesn't need execution history anyway

3. Futures Need Special Handling

Use localSymbol not symbol (NQZ5 vs NQ)
Divide avgCost by multiplier for display
Include multiplier in P&L calculations
Contract creation: Future(symbol, exchange='CME', currency='USD')

4. Position Filtering is Critical

OTC stocks (TOGI, MRAI) - can't get historical data
CVR rights - not tradable
Warrants - separate instruments
Delisted (.OLD suffix) - no market data
Filter by pattern matching + secType

5. Windows Unicode Issues

Windows console uses CP-1252 by default
Checkmarks (✓) and crosses (✗) don't work
Use chcp 65001 for UTF-8 support
Or remove unicode characters from code

Optional: Fix futures contract warnings (1 file update)
Optional: Add alerts (email/Slack on breakout signals)
Consider: Order execution (move from scanning to trading)
